# Self Hosting

The architecture of snips.sh was designed with self-hosting in mind, it's very simple to get deployed. The recommended approach is to use the published container images on [GitHub Container Registry](https://github.com/robherley/snips.sh/pkgs/container/snips.sh).

## Quick Start

Start the service with HTTP on `8080` and SSH on `2222`, and mount a `/data` directory.

```
docker run -p 2222:2222 -p 8080:8080 -v $PWD/data:/data ghcr.io/robherley/snips.sh
```

You should be able to reach the Web UI at `http://localhost:8080`

And the TUI/SSH server will be available at: `ssh localhost -p 2222`

> **Warning**
> This default configuration should not be used for a public instance, please be sure to look over the config and replace any secret configuration values (like the HMAC signing key).

## Configuration

All of snips' configuration is driven by environment variables. To view all the available options (and their default setting), you can run the following command:

```
docker run ghcr.io/robherley/snips.sh -usage
```

```

```

### Addresses/Ports

For the HTTP and SSH services, the container images exposes ports `8080` and `2222` respectively, listening on all interfaces so they can be bound properly.

For convenience, the relevant environment variables are set in the Dockerfile already:

```dockerfile
ENV SNIPS_HTTP_INTERNAL=http://0.0.0.0:8080
ENV SNIPS_SSH_INTERNAL=ssh://0.0.0.0:2222

EXPOSE 8080 2222
```

However, for externally facing traffic (like the URLs that appear in commands), you must also specify the `SNIPS_*_EXTERNAL` environment variables (or else they point to localhost).

e.g. if I wanted to host snips on a subdomain on example.com, I would set the following variables like so:

```bash
SNIPS_HTTP_EXTERNAL=https://snips.example.com
SNIPS_SSH_EXTERNAL=ssh://snips.example.com:22
```

### Database

The file specified at `SNIPS_DB_FILEPATH` is the sqlite database that holds all user data. For more infomation managing the database, see [`database.md`](/docs/database.md).

Setting `SNIPS_FILECOMPRESSION` to `false` will disable compression when storing file content to disk. If this option was disabled at any point (or files were created before this option existed), it will not retroactively compress existing files.

### Host Keys

The directory holding the key files should be persistant and not change. If the host keys are not found, snips will automatically generate them when started.

For instance, if the `SNIPS_SSH_HOSTKEYPATH` is `/data/keys/snips`, the the `keys` directory will look like so:

```
keys
├── snips_ed25519
└── snips_ed25519.pub
```

The generated keys will _always_ be [`ec25519`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EdDSA#Ed25519). It's recommended to let snips generate the keys instead of providing your own.

Also, it's very important that the host keys _don't_ change, or else any users are going to see a scary message like so:

```
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
@    WARNING: REMOTE HOST IDENTIFICATION HAS CHANGED!     @
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
IT IS POSSIBLE THAT SOMEONE IS DOING SOMETHING NASTY!
Someone could be eavesdropping on you right now (man-in-the-middle attack)!
It is also possible that a host key has just been changed.
```

Be sure to securely backup any host keys in the event they might be lost.

### Limiting SSH Access

By default, any user with an public key can connect to a snips.sh instance via SSH.

If you want to limit access to who can SSH (and upload) snippets, you can use the `SNIPS_SSH_AUTHORIZEDKEYSPATH` environment variable. If specified, this will limit the SSH server to the public keys defined there.

The format is exactly the same as `authorized_keys` for `sshd(8)`, e.g.

```
ssh-ed25519 AAAAC3NzaC1lZDI1NTE5AAAAIEnqsMuqOhEVw3HyWMp2fqqn6l1IZtJHD1UWkOXszUcl
ssh-ed25519 AAAAC3NzaC1lZDI1NTE5AAAAIBBMu3TbOgxpvYrcQQG6VHSgrwMzAsFg2s+UX5JMNjNI
ssh-ed25519 AAAAC3NzaC1lZDI1NTE5AAAAIKrOJrpYRgEiuGuoNhyPbeEldjIRkwRG/fjjySPUks/y
```

For an account on GitHub, you can use `https://github.com/<username>.keys` to generate it. For example, if I wanted to allow access for `robherley`:

```
curl https://github.com/robherley.keys > snips_authorized_keys
```

Alternatively, tools like [`ssh-import-id`](https://manpages.ubuntu.com/manpages/bionic/man1/ssh-import-id.1.html) can be used as well:

```
ssh-import-id gh:robherley -o snips_authorized_keys
```

### Statsd Metrics

At runtime, snips.sh will emit various metrics if the `SNIPS_METRICS_STATSD` is defined. This should be the full udp address with the protocol, e.g. `udp://localhost:8125`.


## Examples

### Docker Compose

Create an environment file, e.g. `snips.env` with k/v pairs that'll look something like:

```bash
SNIPS_HTTP_EXTERNAL=https://snips.example.com
SNIPS_SSH_EXTERNAL=ssh://snips.example.com:22
SNIPS_HMACKEY=correct-horse-battery-staple
```

Then setup a `docker-compose.yml`:

```yaml
version: "3"
services:
  snips:
    image: 'ghcr.io/robherley/snips.sh:latest'
    restart: unless-stopped
    ports:
      - '80:8080'
      - '22:2222'
    volumes:
      - ./data:/data
    env_file:
      - snips.env
```
